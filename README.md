# Meme Generator with React Hooks

## App Information

### Title: Meme Generator - Scrimba Project

### Description

This app showcases a basic meme generator using React hooks useState and useEffect. It consist on making an API a call on the initial render, and update the meme the state of the meme object every time I changed the texts and the meme image. 

The meme image is extracted from the allMemes array that was initially set in the API call. Every time the button is clicked, we get a random url from the array, and sets it to the randomImage key in the meme object.
